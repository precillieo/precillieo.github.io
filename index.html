          <p>Hi, welcome to my website üëãüèΩ :)</p>
        <h1 id="about" class="header-name">School + Work + Research</h1>
        <p>
          I am a <a href="https://devdegree.ca/" target="_blank">Dev Degree Intern</a> at
          <a href="https://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Shopify</a> in a
          Backend Engineering placement, and to be moving to Applied Machine
          Learning Engineering in January 2025. I am in my fourth year of a
          Bachelor in Computer Science program at
          <a href="https://www.carleton.ca/" target="_blank">Carleton University</a>
          in the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning stream. At the
          moment, I work at the Nesbitt Biology Research Lab as an Undergraduate
          Research Assistant and my current research focuses on improving concussion diagnosis with visual eye tracking and ocular EMG analysis. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I got blessed with a few scholarships for academic and technical excellence during
          my undergraduate days; a few selected ones are the
          <a href="https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/scholarships/generation-google-scholarship" target="_blank">Google Generation Scholarship</a>,
          <a href="https://www.palantir.com/careers/students/scholarship/wit-north-america/" target="_blank">Palantir Women in Tech Scholarship</a>,
          <a href="https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/company/cadence-academic-network/diversity-in-tech-scholarship.html" target="_blank">Cadence Diversity in Tech Scholarship</a>,
          and Ms. Algorithm - Best Female Data Starlet in Nigeria 2020. Another info you may want to know, I was a Medical Rehabilitation student at
          <a href="https://www.oauife.edu.ng/" target="_blank">Obafemi Awolowo University</a> in Nigeria and I left the degree after two years to pursue computer science. I have touched almost every tech domain partially or fully, but I still have a strong bias towards ML Research, AI & Healthcare.
